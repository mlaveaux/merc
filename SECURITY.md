# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable version is supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

A vulnerability can be reported through GitHubs private security reporting featured at [Security](https://github.com/MERCorg/merc/security/advisories).
Alternatively, an email can be send to one of the maintainers, e.g., at m.laveaux(@)tue.nl. We will try to confirm the vulnerability and respond back, and then decide how to deal
with it.
